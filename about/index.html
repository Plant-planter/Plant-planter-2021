            <p>
                Hey, I’m <span class="glow">Austin</span>. I live in Portland, OR. I enjoy spending as much time as I
                can in my garden. My
                favorite things to grow and eat are: cucumbers, green beans, swiss chard, strawberries, tomatillos.
            </p>

                <span class="glow">Annaleigh</span> here, I’m from New Orleans, LA and I love being outdoors hiking,
                camping, swimming and
                skating.
                In my garden I have strawberries, blueberries, cucumbers, peppers, and carrots. : )

                Hi, I'm <span class="glow">Casey</span>. I live in Portland, OR. I'm terrible at gardening but I love
                coding. I'm coding this as a
                peace offering to all the vegetables I've let wither in the past.

                Hi, I’m <span class="glow">Clem</span>. I live in Portland, Oregon. I love rice, playing in the park,
                and writing CSS. My favorite
                things to to grow are thyme, mizuna, shiso, tulsi, astragalus, sorrel, and nasturtiums. Fun fact: I used
                to work on an organic strawberry farm. There are lots of wasps, so there’s a special scooping movement
                to grab strawberries during harvest.

                Hi, I'm <span class="glow">Culi</span>. I currently live in southern California where we can (and
                should) grow more perennials. Gardening as a tradition mostly comes from Europe where annuals were
                mostly grown, so I don't have many favorite typical garden plants. I like perennial greens like katuk
                and chaya. I like spring greens like miner's lettuce (palsingat). I enjoy foraging the landscaping and
                eating natal plums, strawberry tree fruit, and society garlic.

            <h1 class="glow">Land Acknowledgment</h1>
            <p>
                We at Plant Plans would like to acknowledge that <span class="city-name">Portland </span>rests on the traditional land of the
                <span class="people-list">Multnomah, Kathlamet, Clackamas, Chinook, Tuatlitin Kalapuya, and Molalla Tribes</span> amongst many other.
                <br><br>
                Our plant selector is filled with some of the most common fruits and vegetables that people grow in
                their garden’s, but why are these the most common fruits and vegetables that people grow? While working
                on this project we couldn’t help but recognize the affects of colonialism and the erasure of native
                plants and agricultural techniques. European settlers brought with them their own agricultural ideas and
                as they moved further and further west traditional agricultural techniques and plants native to these
                areas were replaced with those of the european colonizers. Vegetables and fruits were bred to grow in
                places that they otherwise wouldn’t and eventually monoculture (single species planting) became the
                preferred agriculture technique of the west. The idea of monoculture and the labeling of many native
                plants as weeds helped stigmatize indigenous practices and normalize their erasure.
