                Hey, I’m Austin. I live in Portland, OR. I enjoy spending as much time as I can in my garden. My
                favorite things to grow and eat are: cucumbers, green beans, swiss chard, strawberries, tomatillos.
            </p>

                Annaleigh here, I’m from New Orleans, LA and I love being outdoors hiking, camping, swimming and
                skating.
                In my garden I have strawberries, blueberries, cucumbers, peppers, and carrots. : )

                Hi, I'm Casey. I live in Portland, OR. I'm terrible at gardening but I love coding. I'm coding this as a
                peace offering to all the vegetables I've let wither in the past.

                Hi, I’m Clem. I live in Portland, Oregon. I love rice, playing in the park, and writing CSS. My favorite
                things to to grow are thyme, mizuna, shiso, tulsi, astragalus, sorrel, and nasturtiums. Fun fact: I used
                to work on an organic strawberry farm. There are lots of wasps, so there’s a special scooping movement
                to grab strawberries during harvest.
